# Risk-Analysis-webapp
This is Project made for IITK course CS631 risk analysis and assessment
Risk analysis and assessment:Risk assessment is the process of determining the likelihood of threats being used against the vulnerabilities present in a system component and drawing conclusions about the resulting impact when a successful compromise occurs.

Requirements:
1.Updated internet browser to run the Html files
2.Django should be installed in your system to run a local server.

Execution:
 open a Shell/terminal/command prompt in current folder location.
 install django if not installed already by executing command "conda install -c anaconda django" in temrinal window.
then run the command to run the local server to host web app that we built by executing "python manage.py runserver"
It will show you a http server link if everything executed perfectly something like "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
Copy and paste the above URL in browser preferably Google Chrome.
 Now you can use this website for doing Risk assesment for your organization.
